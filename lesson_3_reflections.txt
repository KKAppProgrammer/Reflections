When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  To have copy or share with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  To have sure what I share with other people.
  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  Forks: clone repository on GitHub directly. Clone: I can clone GitHub repository to my local repository. Branches can be different solutions in my project.
  
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  To make local merge if needed and than push final version.
