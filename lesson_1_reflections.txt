How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped me find exact place where the bug is.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can find differences, so i can quicker find the solution.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: you decide when to commit. Cons: you have to control it.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because e.g. Google Docs can't treat all this commits as one.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    When use these commands I can find IDs of commits and make the compare.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I know that i have possibility to return to each version of code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Some interesting project :)
